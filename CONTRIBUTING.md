## How to contribute?

NOTE: *We DO NOT add leetcode problems. They are just applications of basic principles that can be found in other algorithms included in the repository.*

### Did you find a bug?

**Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Project Issues](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues).
  - If it is mentioned in the issues and you want to fix it, [fork](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/fork) the repository and submit your implementation in a pull request. The project maintainers will evaluate it.
  - If the bug is **NOT** mentioned in the issues, [open a new issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title**, a clear **description** and a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

NOTE: *Please avoid opening issues asking to be "assigned" to a particular algorithm. This merely creates unnecessary noise for maintainers. Instead, please submit your implementation in a pull request and project maintainers will evaluate it.*



### Do you want to contribute to the documentation?
   - [Fork](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/fork) the repository and make necessary changes.
   - Create a pull request.
   - It will be put under review for approval.
   - If approved, the requested changes will be merged to the repository.

### Do you want to add a new feature?

- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new).
- Be sure to include a **title**, a clear **description** and a **test case** demonstrating the new feature you want to add to the project.


### Do you have questions about the source code?

- Ask any question about how to use the repository in the [TheAlgorithms room in GITTER](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community?source=orgpage#) or [open a new issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new)
