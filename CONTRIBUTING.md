## How to contribute?

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Project Issues](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues).

- Please avoid opening issues asking to be "assigned” to a particular algorithm. This merely creates unnecessary noise for maintainers. Instead, please submit your implementation in a pull request and project maintainers will evaluate it.

- If you are unable to find an open issue referring to the same problem, depending on the type of issue follow the appropriate steps:

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

- Please read the documentation here [Contributing to the Documentation](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), [open a new issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new), make changes, and then create a pull request, it will be put under review and accepted if it is appropriate.

#### **Do you want to add a new feature?**

- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title, clear description** and **test case** demonstrating the new feature you want to add to the project.

#### **Do you want to fix a bug?**

- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and a clear description** and a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use the repository in the [TheAlgorithms room in GITTER](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community?source=orgpage#) or [open a new issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new)
