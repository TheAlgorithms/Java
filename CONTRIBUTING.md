:+1::tada: Before guiding you through the contribution process TheAlgorithms/Java thank you for being one of us! :+1::tada:

## How to contribute?

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Project Issues](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues).

* Please avoid opening issues asking to be "assigned” to a particular algorithm.  This merely creates unnecessary noise for maintainers.  Instead, please submit your implementation in a pull request and it will be evaluated by project maintainers.

* If you are unable to find an open issue refering to the same problem, depending on the type of issue follow the appropriate steps:

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

* Please read the documentation in here [Contributing to the Documentation]() ,[open a new one issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new), make changes and then create a pull request, it will be put under review and accepted if it is approprite.

#### **Do you want to add a new feature?**
* [Open a new one issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and a clear description** and a **test case** demonstrating the new feature that you want to add to the project.

#### **Do you want to fix a bug?**
* [Open a new one issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new).Be sure to include a **title and a clear description** and a **test case** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occuring.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the repository in the [TheAlgorithms room in GITTER](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community?source=orgpage#) or [open a new one issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/new)

:+1::tada: That's all you need to know about the process now it's your turn to help us improve the repository, thank you again! :+1::tada:
