     * This class will generate the conway sequence also known as the look and say sequence.
     * To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the
     *previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example: 1 is
     *read off as "one 1" or 11. 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21. 21 is read off as "one 2, one 1"
     *or 1211. 1211 is read off as "one 1, one 2, two 1s" or 111221. 111221 is read off as "three
     *1s, two 2s, one 1" or 312211. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence
