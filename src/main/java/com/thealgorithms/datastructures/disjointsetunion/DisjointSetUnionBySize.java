/**
 * Disjoint Set Union (DSU) with Union by Size.
 * This data structure tracks a set of elements partitioned into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
 * It supports two primary operations efficiently:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Find: Determine which subset a particular element belongs to.</li>
 *     <li>Union: Merge two subsets into a single subset using union by size.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Union by size always attaches the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree.
 * This helps keep the tree shallow, improving the efficiency of find operations.
 *
