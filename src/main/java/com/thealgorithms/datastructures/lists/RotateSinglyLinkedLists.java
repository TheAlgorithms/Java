/**
 * The RotateSinglyLinkedLists class provides a method to rotate a singly linked list
 * to the right by a specified number of positions.
 * <p>
 * In a right rotation by `k` steps, each node in the list moves `k` positions to the right.
 * Nodes that are rotated off the end of the list are placed back at the beginning.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Given linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = 2, the output will be:
 * 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Edge Cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If the list is empty, returns null.</li>
 *   <li>If `k` is 0 or a multiple of the list length, the list remains unchanged.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Complexity:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.</li>
 *   <li>Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
