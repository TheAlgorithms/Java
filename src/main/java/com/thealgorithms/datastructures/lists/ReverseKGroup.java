/**
 * The ReverseKGroup class provides functionality to reverse nodes in a
 * linked list in groups of k nodes.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm follows the approach of reversing the linked list in segments of
 * size k. If the remaining nodes are fewer than k, they remain unchanged.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Given a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and k = 3,
 * the output will be: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation contains:
 * - {@code length(Node head)}: A method to calculate the length of the linked list.
 * - {@code reverse(Node head, int count, int k)}: A helper method that reverses the nodes
 *   in the linked list in groups of k.
 * - {@code reverseKGroup(Node head, int k)}: The main method that initiates the reversal
 *   process by calling the reverse method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Complexity:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.</li>
 *   <li>Space Complexity: O(1), as we are reversing in place.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
