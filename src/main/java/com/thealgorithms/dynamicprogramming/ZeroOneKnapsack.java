/**
 * Class to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using recursion.
 *
 * The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic dynamic programming problem
 * where we are given weights and values of `n` items. We need to put
 * these items in a knapsack of capacity `W` to get the maximum total value
 * in the knapsack. We can either include an item or exclude it â€” but cannot
 * include it more than once.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(2^n) in worst case for the pure recursive approach (due to overlapping subproblems).
 * Using memoization or bottom-up dynamic programming reduces the time complexity to O(nW).
 *
 * Example:
 * val[] = {15, 14, 10, 45, 30}
 * wt[]  = {2, 5, 1, 3, 4}
 * W = 7
 * Output: 75
