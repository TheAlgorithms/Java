    /**
     *In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients that
     *arises in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra. In much of the Western world, it is
     *named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it
     *centuries before him in India, Persia, China, Germany, and Italy.
     *
     * The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n=0 at the top
     *(the 0th row). The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k=0 and are
     *usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows. The triangle may be
     *constructed in the following manner: In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero
     *entry 1. Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to
     *the left with the number above and to the right, treating blank entries as 0. For example, the
     *initial number in the first (or any other) row is 1 (the sum of 0 and 1), whereas the numbers
     *1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row. *
