/**
 * This class provides a method to perform fast exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring),
 * which calculates (base^exp) % mod efficiently.
 *
 * <p>The algorithm works by repeatedly squaring the base and reducing the exponent
 * by half at each step. It exploits the fact that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If exp is even, (base^exp) = (base^(exp/2))^2</li>
 *   <li>If exp is odd, (base^exp) = base * (base^(exp-1))</li>
 * </ul>
 * The result is computed modulo `mod` at each step to avoid overflow and keep the result within bounds.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(log(exp)) â€” much faster than naive exponentiation (O(exp)).</p>
 *
 * For more information, please visit {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring}
