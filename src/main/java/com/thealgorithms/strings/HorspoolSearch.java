/**
 * This class is not thread safe<br>
 * <br>
 * (From wikipedia) In computer science, the Boyer–Moore–Horspool algorithm or
 * Horspool's algorithm is an algorithm for finding substrings in strings. It
 * was published by Nigel Horspool in 1980.
 * <br>
 * <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore%E2%80%93Horspool_algorithm>Wikipedia
 * page</a><br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <p>
 * An explanation:<br>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Horspool algorithm is a simplification of the Boyer-Moore algorithm in
 * that it uses only one of the two heuristic methods for increasing the number
 * of characters shifted when finding a bad match in the text. This method is
 * usually called the "bad symbol" or "bad character" shift. The bad symbol
 * shift method is classified as an input enhancement method in the theory of
 * algorithms. Input enhancement is (from wikipedia) the principle that
 * processing a given input to a problem and altering it in a specific way will
 * increase runtime efficiency or space efficiency, or both. Both algorithms try
 * to match the pattern and text comparing the pattern symbols to the text's
 * from right to left.<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <p>
 * In the bad symbol shift method, a table is created prior to the search,
 * called the "bad symbol table". The bad symbol table contains the shift values
 * for any symbol in the text and pattern. For these symbols, the value is the
 * length of the pattern, if the symbol is not in the first (length - 1) of the
 * pattern. Else it is the distance from its rightmost occurrence in the pattern
 * to the last symbol of the pattern. In practice, we only calculate the values
 * for the ones that exist in the first (length - 1) of the pattern.<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <p>
 * For more details on the algorithm and the more advanced Boyer-Moore I
 * recommend checking out the wikipedia page and professor Anany Levitin's book:
 * Introduction To The Design And Analysis Of Algorithms.
